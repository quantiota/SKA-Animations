# SKA Framework Animations

Educational animations visualizing key insights from the **Structured Knowledge Architecture (SKA)** framework.

## About SKA

SKA reimagines neural computation as continuous fields where entropy, knowledge, and decisions are spatially varying quantities governed by geometric principles.

Developed by **Bouarfa Mahi** at **Quantiota**.
